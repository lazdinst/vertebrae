/* - MVC ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks divide your application into
 * manageable components to make it easier to organize and comprehend.
 *
 * Backbone is a hierarchical MVC - Models are organized into Collections
 * in order to track your data.
 *
 * In general:
 * - _Models_ keep track of your data
 * - _Views_ render your models to expose the data to your users
 *
 * For now, we'll focus on one piece at a time, starting with the _Model_.
 * As we go through, refer to the [documentation](http://backbonejs.org/)
 * with questions, and don't be afraid to use the halp desk.
 */

/* - Backbone MODEL -----------------------------------------------------------
* Backbone gives us a model class, which we will extend to contain
* properties/methods specific to our application model.
*
* For example, this is where we store information about how each model renders
* into HTML. It's also where any functionality specific to a model is stored.
*
* Remember: a model is just an object. 'Model' is a technical term in Backbone
* (and other similar frameworks) used to talk about the objects used to
* store application data.
*/
var Tweet = Backbone.Model.extend({  
  /* This is just a bare bones Backbone model. No extra special bits to add.
   * Note that Backbone.Model is just another JavaScript class. We use extend
   * to set it up as a normal class instantiator, with the normal
   * pseudoclassical hierarchy - NOTE: extend (in backbone) is NOT the same 
   * function you've seen in underscore! Backbone.Model.extend is going to 
   * subclass Backbone.Model --basically make a constructor (function) whose 
   * prototype has your provided properties.
   */
});

/* Backbone models are pseudoclassically instantiated: */
var myTweet = new Tweet();

/* Backbone models are meant to store data, so it's important to understand
 * their getters and setters: */
myTweet.set('message', 'Hello, world!');

/* Using the reference, get the message attribute of the model and display it:
 * http://backbonejs.org/#Model-get */

// window.alert(YOUR CODE HERE);

/* - Backbone EVENTS ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Backbone gives us the ability to listen for events on our models,
 * similar to how we register events on the DOM using jQuery.
 * If something in our model changes, we can listen for that change and react
 * accordingly when the event happens.  When we want to register a listener,
 * we use the method `model.on`.
 *
 * `model.on` takes two arguments:
 * 1. The event name being triggered.
 * 2. A function that does the thing you want to do when the event happens (i.e. the event handler, or callback function).
 *
 * Backbone gives you a couple of events for free, like `change`.
 * This event is triggered automatically if something changes in the model:
 * an attribute is added to the model, is deleted, or is changed.
 *
 * Before we listen for our first event, take a gander at the reference:
 * http://backbonejs.org/#Events-on
 */

/* Listen for our model's `change` event: */
myTweet.on('change',
  function(/* this event holds information about the change: */ e) {
    // Let ourselves know that something was changed:
    console.info('Something in this tweet model was changed!');
    console.log(e);

    // Write code to log the changed attribute:
    // console.log(YOUR CODE HERE);
  }
);

/* Backbone works through getters/setters. If you change something on
 * your model as if it were a plain old javascript object,
 * Backbone will not know to fire the change event. */
// myTweet.message = 'This will not work';

/* Instead, we need to use the baked in getters/setters given to us
 * by the framework. Review these now (at http://backbonejs.org/#Model-set)
 * and write a one-liner that will make our `change` listener fire: */

// myTweetYOUR CODE HERE;

/* Once you have the `change` event firing, move on to rendering! */
