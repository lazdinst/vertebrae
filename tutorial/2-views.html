/* It's time to get our hands dirty.
 *
 * This section may seem like a jump in scope, but you

 * prototypical inheritance, and `extend` to follow these Backbone models.
 *
 * If you feel lost, ask your peers; if you're still lost, call for halp!
 *
 * Remember, always, to __check [the documentation](http://backbonejs.org/)__!
 */

/* Let's make a functional model. Fill in the Comment model with the functions
 * that we will need to make changes to the object and set initial values.
 */
var Comment = Backbone.Model.extend({
  /* The argument passed to `initialize` is what the model is instantiated with:
   * in `new Comment(message)`, message will be passed to `initialize`. */
  initialize: function(message) {
    /* Set the initial values for `votes` to 0 and `message` to the message.

/* - Backbone VIEW ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Now that we have a model, we'll want a view to display it.
 * Frequently, backbone views will be the place where you
 * register event listeners (for example, to listen for changes)
 * and rerender something if one of your models changes.
 *
 * For example, you would re-draw a comment on the page if
 * the comment model changes.  Lets dive into how to make that happen.
 */

// Views are created by extending the Backbone.View, just like models:
var CommentView = Backbone.View.extend({
  /* Our initialize function defines methods that we want available on
   * ALL instances of this class.  In our case, we are going to want
   * every comment's view to have an event listener on `change` so that
   * it will re-render itself if the `votes` attribute changes. */
  initialize: function() {
    this.model.on('change:votes', function() {
    /* Let's break down the line above:
     * - `this`           => the CommentView instance
     * - `this.model`     => the model associated with this view instance
     *   - This has not been set yet - it will be set later to a Comment model.
     * - `this.model.on`  => register an event listener to the model
     * - `'change:votes'` => this first argument defines what to listen for
     *   - We can listen for a change on a specific attribute using a colon.
     * - `function`       => this is the callback for this event listener */
      this.render()
    /*   - Usually, we can't rely on `this` being what we think it is in
     *      an event listener. However, Backbone allows us to specify what
     *      `this` will be in the third argument of `model.on`,
     *      as we will do in the next line: */
    }, this);
    /* We've passed in `this` from the the outer scope into the event listener,
     * making it so that `this` is bound to the individual comment's view,
     * and not some random thing.
     *
     * If this is confusing, ask your peers and halp desk
     * until you have a good grasp of the concept.
     */
  },

  // Now that we have an event listener calling `render`, we must define it:
  render: function() {
    // As in step2, we define a template:
    var html = [
      '<div>',
        '<span class="votes">',
          this.model.get('votes'),
        '<span>',
        '<span class="comment">',
          this.model.get('message'),
        '</span>',
        '</br>',
      '</div>'
    ].join('');

    /* When we defined our own render function, we had to deal with jQuery.
     * Backbone gives us a convenience method to take care of this:
     * every view has a jQuery element associated with it, called `$el`.
     *
     * Read about it [here](http://backbonejs.org/#View-$el) quickly,
     * then come back.
     *
     * $el is a bucket for the html of a particular view.
     * If you modify the $el, the html on the page will be changed.
     * Each view will have it's own $el, and you can always get to it
     * using `this.$el`.
     *
     * Rendering now becomes as simple as setting the $el's html: */
    return this.$el.html(html);

    /* We're also returning the $el. It's already been modified and updated,
     * but it is not on the page yet.
     * In a couple lines, we will put it onto the page; then we can modify it
     * using only $el - but we need to get it onto the page first,
     * so we need to return the html in order to append it to the page.
     */
  }
});

// That's about it! Let's take it for a spin:

/* Create a new comment model using our Comment class,
 * passing the first message as an argument: */
var comment = new Comment('This is a message');

// Create a view, and associate it with this model:
var commentView = new CommentView({ model: comment });

/* Notice that we instantiate the view with an object {model: comment}.
 * This is called an options hash. With views, if we pass an object with
 * information that the view expects, we can modify things about the view.
 *
 * In this case, this is the way we associate the view to its model.
 *
 * NOTE: You can't just put any object in the options hash as the model,
 * it _must_ be a Backbone model.
 */

// Append the view to the page. This is why we returned html from `render`:
// $('body').append(commentView.render());

/* The number of votes should be 0.
 * We set that as the initial default value in the comment model.
 *
 * Let's change it and see our eventlistener in action.
 * Uncomment the line below and reload the page,
 * and it should say '1' to the left of the comment. */
// comment.upvote();

/* play with this in your console as well.
 * You can modify the comment object in the same way we just did:
 * ```
 * comment.upvote();
 * comment.downvote();
 * ```
 *
 * Try voting up and voting down a couple of times and
 * watch the eventlistener auto update the view.  Pretty cool, eh?
