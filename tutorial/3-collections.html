 * that makes them a breeze to use. I'll start you off both model and view: */

  /* This is purposely different from the previous steps.
   * Make sure to do those first (!!!) and then check here for new patterns. */

  initialize: function(message, votes) {
    this.set('message', message);

/* The reason we want a collection is to track our models.
 * Let's use this collection to:
 * - display every comment in it
 * - count the total number of votes, across all comments
 *
 * That means we need to write a new view: */
var CommentsView = Backbone.View.extend({
  /* Again, we use our initialize function to register listeners.
   * In this case, we want to know when votecounts of the models
   * in our collection changes. */

      '<ul>',
      '</ul>',

        // The total number of votes

      // YOUR CODE HERE
    }));

// That's it! Let's watch some stats:

/* Create a few new comment models using our Comment class: */
var commentList = [
  new Comment('Doug!'), // default to 0 votes
  new Comment('Doug?', 1),
  new Comment('Doug.', 2),
  new Comment('"Doug".', 3),
  new Comment('Doug?!', 4)];

// Add all of these to a new collection:
var comments = new Comments(commentList);

// Associate a view to the collection:
var commentsView = new CommentsView({ collection: comments });

// Append it to the page (uncomment this when you are ready):
// $('body').append(commentsView.render());
